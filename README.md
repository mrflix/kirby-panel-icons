# Kirby Panel-Icons

The [icons](https://getkirby.com/docs/reference/panel/icons) for the [Kirby](https://getkirby.com/) Panel are a subset of the [Remix Icon](https://remixicon.com/) set. This plugin is a helper to easily add additional icons for use in blueprints.

## Usage

1. Go to [remixicon.com](https://remixicon.com/) and find an icon you want to include
2. Press "Copy SVG"
3. Add a new line to `index.js`, pick a name and paste the svg string as the value
4. Use the icon in the blueprint by referencing it's name

## Similar Plugins

- [Kirby Remix Icons](https://github.com/veryrobert/kirby-remix-icons) includes the whole Remix icons set. Didn't try it yet. Didn't know about it when I wrote this helper. Might be simpler to just use this plugin instead.
